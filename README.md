# Scrolly

Inspired by a musician friend, this browser extension scrolls down webpages at a configurable rate. The primary use-case in mind is for musicians using sheet music or tablature on a monitor so that they need not worry about finding a rest long enough to scroll down manually.

In a second iteration or version, it might be cool to add a feature where the page may be turned after a certain amount of time, perhaps time that could be entered in manually or determine through some sort of MV.
